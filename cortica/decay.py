MemoryDecay: Time-aware memory weighting and retention logic for Cortica.

This module introduces lightweight aging mechanics to mimic cognitive memory decay:
- Memories lose strength over time unless refreshed
- Accessing a memory reinforces it
- Low-strength memories can be pruned or deprioritized
